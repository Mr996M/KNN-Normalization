## KNN-Normalization
This resource repository stores java code to explore the influence of normalization on the accuracy of KNN classification algorithm. The dataset used for analysis comes from the network, and the results of the experimental test are recorded in the test.xlsx file. The script files in the MATLAB folder are used to draw visualizations to analyze the data.

Each .m file in the MATLAB folder is the image drawing of the data in the test.xlsx file in the KNN-normalization directory, which is used to analyze the effect of KNN classification algorithm using three distances to calculate, and horizontally compares the relationship between the error rates calculated by different distance formulas. The effect of whether the data set is normalized or not on the error rate is compared longitudinally. The scatter line chart of the function of the error rate and k value change and the fitting curve of part of the interval are plotted in each file.
